Hi 👋, I'm Hossein

I'm Hossein Falah, a 21-year-old software engineer from Iran with a passion for backend development. Over the past year, I've gained hands-on experience building scalable backend systems using Node.js and NestJS.

My coding journey may have started recently, but it’s been full of challenges, learning, and growth. I enjoy designing clean, maintainable APIs and diving deeper into software architecture and networking every day.

Beyond coding, I love exploring the Linux ecosystem, customizing my desktop, and optimizing workflows for efficiency and simplicity. When I need a break, music helps me stay focused and creative.

I’m inspired by developers like Uncle Bob, striving to write code that is not just functional but elegant, maintainable, and future-proof. Writing clean, structured, and scalable code is what drives me.
